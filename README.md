This repository provides an implementation of the Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy using Python. It demonstrates how to simulate regular investments in a stock over time, while accounting for factors such as fees and market volatility.

By using libraries like `yfinance`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`, this project fetches historical stock data, calculates the total investment and portfolio value, and visualizes the strategy's performance over time.

For more details on the DCA strategy and its benefits, check out the [full article here](https://hulela.co.za/trading-strategies-dollar-cost-averaging-dca-e54f5b42814f).

Feel free to explore and adapt the code for your own trading strategies!
